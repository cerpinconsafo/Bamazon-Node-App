## Deployed Page

As this is a CLI based application simulating a customer storefront and IMS, we access this program through the terminal.

Users must download all files, as well as set up the database through MySQL.

Once the database is initialized, path to the main folder via the terminal, and run with the following command: 

node bamazon.js

This will launch the CLI, and you can begin using the program as a local copy.  There is no public database set up to access.  This is merely for demonstration purposes.

## Functionality

The customer/manager is able to navigate menus and make selections through corresponding alphanumeric inputs

The following videos demonstrate the custom and manager POV seperately.

I highly encourage setting the watch speed to 1.25 XD

There is currently no functionality to save user orders, the databases merely update and persist through each use of the app.
